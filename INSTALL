Installation Instructions for SRweb
==================================

* Install php-Smarty:

	+ for yum: `sudo yum install php-Smarty`
	+ for apt: `sudo apt-get install smarty`
	+ (for both, ensure config.inc.php is set correctly)

* ensure 'templates_compiled' is owned by apache user. There are a number
  of ways you can do this:

	+ `chown $APACHEU:$APACHEG templates_compiled/` (where $APACHEU
	  and $APACHEG are the Apache user and Apache group, respectively)
	+ `setfacl -m u:$APACHEU:rwx templates_compiled/` to allow r/w/x
	  access to the apache user aswell as the owner.
	+ You could also chmod, but depending on the dir's location, that
          may not be the best way.

* modify the .htaccess file to use the correct 'RewriteBase' and ensure
  mod_rewrite is installed and loaded in the main Apache configuration file.

* ensure that mod_expires is installed and loaded in the main Apache
  configuration file.


That should be it! Hope that helped.
