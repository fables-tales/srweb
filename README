Introduction
============

In the spirit of the project, this documentation will be written in a 
markdown syntax -- all will become clear...

For INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS, please see the INSTALL file.

Srweb is a git-, PHP-, and Smarty-based templating system for producing a 
website. Some of its merits include:

  * Simple setup.

  * Completely file-based (NO database!).

  * changes can be made using git:

      + you can accept git patches for changes;

      + people can clone and run the site locally with borderline negligible 
        modifications, make changes and push them back; and

      + you can revert the site to an earlier point in time with ease, for 
        example.

  * A simple syntax (MarkDown) for writing content, with a fallback to 
    standard HTML should MarkDown prove insufficient. (Hey, no offence 
    MarkDown, but when it comes to image stuff, things get a little 
    tricky.) More on this in a minute.

  * A simple, file-based, news-feed-producing system with an automatic RSS 
    feed.



Style Guidlines & Content Production
====================================

Rules:

1. use MarkDown (Syntax : http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

2. USE MarkDown

3. If you have to use HTML:

     + Don't use any style attributes in anything

     + Use a semantic markup (by that I mean use a hierachical layout)

4. If you have to style your elements:

     + Do it properly, and by that I mean use CSS, and in 'css/content_extra.css'
       -- you can address your specific element(s) using an ID for the content 
       <div> (the content <div> is given an ID of the page name e.g. 
       'sponsors/index' with slashes '/' replaced by underscores '_').

       For example, a page 'bees/bob' like:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//TITLE:        Bees
//DESCRIPTION:  Why it's the bees/bob page, of course!
//KEYWORDS:	bees, bob
//CONTENT_TYPE: markdown

| col  | col  |
| ---- | ---- |
| data | data |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       ... a simple MarkDown (extra) table, you could target it with the 
       following CSS:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
div#bees_bob table {
   color:red;
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

       ... in the 'css/content_extra.css' file.

The first thing to note is the header at the top of the file. The text after 
'//TITLE:' will appear in the page's <title> tag. The DESCRIPTION will 
appear in the relevent <meta> tag, and the same applies for KEYWORDS. The 
CONTENT_TYPE specifies how the file will be parsed. The Currently supported 
formats are as follows:

  * 'markdown' --> MarkDown, obviously
  * 'md'       --> shorthand for MarkDown
  * 'html'     --> HTML source

The prefered method of content production is MarkDown (you may have guessed) 
and HTML should be used in exceptional circumstances. It is important to 
note, though, that HTML tags can appear in MarkDown. For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Title
=======

<img src="src.png" alt="alt" title="title" class="right" />

Some paragraph text.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will produce HTML output as follows:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<h1>A Title</h1>
<p><img src="src.png" alt="alt" title="title" class="right" /></p>
<p>Some paragraph text.</p>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Which, with the current CSS, will produce a page with the <img> floated to 
the right.

Other valid content file headers include:

  * PUB_DATE, which is used as the publication date for news (so RSS feed) 
    items.


Classes which can be applied to images (and also HTML5 videos) are as follows:

  * 'left' : to float an image/video to the left of the page
  * 'right': to float an image/video to the right of the page



Content should be placed in the 'content/${lang}/' directory. Anything in this
directory will appear under the BASE_URI directory on the site. Subdirectories
will also work.

Currently, language selection occurs based on the client's configuration (i.e. a
browser preference setting). There is a 'content/default' symlink to the default
language (currently English) and it is what pages are based upon. For the page to
exist in another language, it must first exist in the default language. If an
ISO standard language is set in the browser at a higher level of preference than
the default, and the requested page exists in the more-prefered language, then
that page will be served in the more-prefered language, and only when the correct
mapping is set up in 'config.inc.php'.

At the moment, only content files can be in multiple languages. The pages that
can't be in different languages, currently, are as follows:

  * the home page (i.e. 'templates/home.tpl')
  * the news page (i.e. 'templates/news.tpl')
  * the news feed


Producing News
==============

Producing a news feed item is simple, follow the following steps:

  1. create a file, with a name of your choosing, in the 'news/' directory.

  2. fill said file with the news content you want, remembering to set the 
     headers {TITLE, DESCRIPTION, KEYWORDS, CONTENT_TYPE, PUB_DATE}, where 
     PUB_DATE is the date the feed was published. The format can be anything 
     PHP's strtotime() function can handle.

  3. You're done! The page will be viewable as a normal page, it will appear 
     in the news feed (RSS), and also on the home page in the latest news 
     section. It'll also be in the 'news/index' representation of the feed.
     (You will, or course, need to wait for memcache's cache to expire (or 
     flush it :D).) The TITLE, DESCRIPTION and a formatted version of PUB_DATE
     will appear in the feed.
