Tech Days
=========

Throughout the year we run intensive sessions knowns as "Tech Days" that allow the local teams to get further help from mentors.

These all-day events are held at each of the SR Branches,
 with all the local teams,
 their robots and mentors in attendance.
This allows the teams to make great progress on their robots,
 and to work out any problems they may have been having in the presence of a much greater concentration of mentors and experience.

Teams also tend to get a large proportion of their robot built or working on these days.
As they get a full day working on it,
 while during school times they may only get one hour a week for example.

Tech Days also allow the teams to once again meet their competitor teams,
 show off their robot to everyone and to exchange ideas with other teams face-to-face.

In the past there has also been a testing area present at the Tech Days,
 which allows teams to test out how their robots behave in an arena made of the same materials as the one at the competition.
For example, some teams have traction issues on their wheels,
 here it can be tested thoroughly and any bugs their code may have cn be worked out.
