The competition
===============

Details for the 2012 competition game will be made available at [KickStart](/schools/kickstart),
 which marks the beginning of the competition, in September.

Event
-----

The competition itself is a two day event,
 held at the University of Southampton.
The first day is very much like a centralised [Tech Day](/schools/tech_days) &ndash;
 it provides an opportunity to test the robots in the real arena,
 and to work out any problems they may have amongst a plethora of experience provided by the mentors that will be present.
On the second day the competition itself begins.
Every robot will have many chances in the arena,
 but at the end of the day only one will emerge victorious.

2011

In 2011 the competition game involved a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.
Full details about the game played last year is still available in the [rules](/docs/rules/).

Last year the competition was on the weekend of the 9th and 10th of April, 2011.

Further event details and the results are available from the
 [news article](/news/2011-05-04_sr2011_comp_happened) posted shortly afterwards.
