The competition
===============

The 2013 competition will see over thirty teams vying for the prestigious title of Student Robotics Champion.
The challenge this year, entitled *A Strange Game*, will see an ambitious and quirky mix of robots all looking to dominate a game of naughts and crosses.
Each robot, equipped with six rather large cardboard boxes, will attempt to take-over squares in a 3x3 grid in the centre of an arena. The more squares owned in a row or column, the more points a robot scores.
For details about the game, the scoring method and more, head over to [this year's competition rules](/docs/rules).

Event
-----

The competition itself is a two day event,
 held at the University of Southampton.
The first day is very much like a centralised [Tech Day](/schools/tech_days) &ndash;
 it provides an opportunity to test the robots in the real arena,
 and to work out any problems they may have amongst a plethora of experience provided by the mentors that will be present.
On the second day the competition itself begins.
Every robot will have many chances in the arena,
 but at the end of the day only one will emerge victorious.

2012
----

The 2012 competition, *Pirate Plunder*, considerably increased the scope for interesting activity compared to our previous games.
Autonomous robots raced to collect cube-shaped tokens and get them back to the bucket in their home zone.
Robots could also steal each other's buckets, leading to an variety of possible tactics.
The [full rules](/resources/2012/rulebook.pdf) of the 2012 game are available for those interested.

2011
----

In 2011 the competition game involved a track-based arena with some scattered baked bean tins to pick up.
The arena can be seen in the diagram to the right.
Full details about the game played last year is still available in the [rules](/docs/rules/).

Last year the competition was on the weekend of the 9th and 10th of April, 2011.

Further event details and the results are available from the
