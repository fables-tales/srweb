<h2>Teams</h2>

	Student Robotics teams are generally comprised of about 4-6 sixth&ndash;form and college students (ages 16-18),
	plus an adult <a href="/schools/team-leaders/">team-leader</a> (usually a teacher).
	If you'd like to enter a team with a different make-up,
	please do <a href="/about/contactus">get in contact with us</a>,
	but note that the presence of a responsible adult team-leader is required.
