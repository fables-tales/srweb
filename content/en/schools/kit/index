The Kit
=======

We design, build, test, and ship a unique and powerful robotics kit to
schools.  We don't stop there.  We then support its use in those
schools.  This is made possible through the generosity of our sponsors
[sponsors](/sponsors/) coupled with the enthusiasm of our team of
volunteers.

For Student Robotics 2011 (which finished in April 2011) we thoroughly
redesigned our electronics kit based on our years of experience with
our previous kit in schools.  We produced a kit that was robust,
powerful, and easy to use.

We are always aiming to push the boundaries of what teams can do with
our kit.  The [BeagleBoard](http://beagleboard.org/) that sits at the
heart of the new kit provides us with an excellent platform for us to
build an intensely engrossing robotics experience on top of.  We have
just begun to scratch the surface of what our software will allow
teams to achieve.  Stay tuned.

More information about the kit is available in the
[documentation](/docs/kit) where, alongside the basic specification,
you'll also find the schematics and source code for what we ship.
