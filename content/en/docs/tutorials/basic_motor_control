Basic Motor Control
===================

<div class="warning">This documentation is currently out-of-date, and is in the process of being rewritten.  It should be completed within the next week or so.</div>

The aim of this tutorial is to get a motor turning with your kit. To complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:

* The [power board](/docs/kit/power_board)
* The battery (charged, of course)
* The cable to connect the battery to the power board
* A motor (see specification below)
* 2 lengths of a suitable gauge of wire for your motor
* A [motor board](/docs/kit/motor_board)
* A green _camcon_ connector to plug the motor and motor board together
* 2 SRIC cables (Ethernet cables)
* The USB hub
* The USB hub power cable
* The memory stick
* A soldering Iron
* Some solder wire
* Wire strippers
* A small slotted/flat blade screwdriver (for the _camcon_ screws)

You should be familiar with the setup for most of the above now (if you've read the [walkthrough](/docs/tutorials/walkthrough)), so it's just the motor-related parts that need explaining.


Motor Specification
-------------------

There is a certain specification the motor(s) you use must meet. The criteria are as follows:

* 12V motor
* A stall current of no more than 5A (a [motor board](/docs/kit/motor_board) can only provide 5A, above which it will current limit)


Connecting a Motor
------------------

To plug the motor into the kit, you'll need to solder an appropriate gauge of wire to the terminals on the motor, and connect the other ends to the _camcon_ connector. Like so:

![Motor connected to Camcon](/images/content/kit/motor_and_camcon.png)

<div class="info">You may want to insulate the motor's terminals with some insulation tape (or heat shrink tubing if you've got it) like in the image above.</div>

Now you need to connect the motor to one of your motor boards. You'll need to connect the following:

* Your motor into the motor socket on the motor board;
* One of the SRIC cables from the `OUT` of the power board to the `IN` of the motor board, and the other to the `OUT` of the motor board and the `IN` of the power board;
* The motor power cable (2 green _camcons_ connected together) into the motor power connector on the motor board and one of the motor power connectors on the power board.

You should be familiar with the setup for the rest of the kit used.


Some Code
--------

<div class="warning">You might want to ensure the motor won't take the kit anywhere when you press the run button when testing some of the below code (unless it's in a robot, of course).</div>

The example program we'll write will do a number of things with the motor: forwards and backwards, and different power settings, for example. Let's begin.

To start off with, we'll just make a motor move forwards, then backwards, and then repeat.


### Forwards & Backwards

Doing this is actually very easy; the only thing you need to realise is that a positive number is forwards and a negative number is backwards. 

<div class="warning">The actual direction of travel of a motor, when mounted on a robot, will depend on its orientation and the way in which the wires are connected to the motor board. If the motor appears to be going in the wrong direction, just swap the motor's positive and negative wires over.</div>

Here's the code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from sr import *

def main():

	while True:

		motor[0].target = 50
		yield query.timeout(3)

		motor[0].target = 0
		yield query.timeout(1)

		motor[0].target = -50
		yield query.timeout(3)

		motor[0].target = 0
		yield query.timeout(1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're familiar with the first few lines; in fact, the only lines you may not be familiar with are the `motor[0]...` lines. For a comprehensive reference to the `motor` object, see the `sr` module's [`motor`](/docs/programming/sr/motor/) page. But, to summarise:

<div class="info">`motor[0].target = x` will set the power of the first [motor board](/docs/kit/motor_board) in the [token ring](/docs/kit/token_ring) to `x`, where `x` is a value between `-100` and `100`, inclusive &mdash; in other words: `-100` &le; `x` &le; `100`.</div>

So, `motor[0].target = 50` sets the target power of the first [motor board](/docs/kit/motor_board) in the [token ring](/docs/kit/token_ring) to 50% forwards (i.e. a duty-cycle of 0.5 forwards). As you would expect, then, `motor[0].target = -50` will put the first motor in the token ring into reverse at 50% power. `motor[0].target = 0` will output no power to the motor and stop it.

So, if you put the above code on your robot, you should be able to see a motor spin forwards, stop, spin backwards, stop, and then repeat...


### Changing the Speed

Now we're going to modify the program to vary the speed of the motor. Our aim is to do the forwards and backwards bit (as above), but, before we loop round again, ramp the power up to 70%, then down to -70%, and then back to 0 (all in steps of 10%).

Here's the code:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
from sr import *

def main():

	while True:

		motor[0].target = 50
		yield query.timeout(3)

		motor[0].target = 0
		yield query.timeout(1)

		motor[0].target = -50
		yield query.timeout(3)

		motor[0].target = 0
		yield query.timeout(1)

		# ^^ code from before ^^

		# power up to 70 (from 10)
		for pwr in range(10, 80, 10):
			motor[0].target = pwr
			yield query.timeout(0.1)

		# power down from 70 (to 10)
		for pwr in range(70, 0, -10):
			motor[0].target = pwr
			yield query.timeout(0.1)

		# set power to 0 for a second
		motor[0].target = 0
		query.timeout(1)

		# power "up" to -70 (from -10)
		for pwr in range(-10, -80, -10):
			motor[0].target = pwr
			yield query.timeout(0.1)

		# power "down" to -10 (from -70)
		for pwr in range(-70, 0, 10):
			motor[0].target = pwr
			yield query.timeout(0.1)

		# set power to 0 for a second
		motor[0].target = 0
		query.timeout(1)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Again, as you've seen most of that before, it shouldn't be too difficult to get your head around. The `for` loop may be new, however. The [`for`](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html#for-statements) loop accepts a Python `list` (a `list`, when `print`ed, appears in square brackets like so: `[1, 2, 3]`). For a comprehensive introduction to to `list`s, have a look at [this WikiBooks article](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming/Lists). The `for` loop will iterate over the `list` (i.e. take each element in turn) and make it available in the loop's body as the variable after the the `for` keyword. Here's an example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
for i in [1, 2, 3]:
	print i
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above would output:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1
2
3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then there's the [`range()`](http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#range) function. The `range()` function returns a `list` with its contents dependent on the arguments passed to it. The Python documentation explains it quite nicely:

> `range([start], stop[, step])` (note: the square brackets here mean 'optional')
>
> If the `step` argument is omitted, it defaults to `1`. If the `start` argument is
> omitted, it defaults to `0`. The full form returns a list of plain integers
> `[start,  start + step, start + 2 *  step, ...]`. If `step` is positive, the last
> element is the largest `start + i * step` less than `stop`; if `step` is negative,
> the last element is the smallest `start + i * step` greater than `stop`.

So, based on that, `range(3)` would return the list `[0, 1, 2]` because it is shorthand for `range(0, 3, 1)`. From the quote, you can see that this would return a list starting from `0`, and finishing with the integer one less than `3`, hence the `[0, 1, 2]`.

So, taking `range(10, 80, 10)`, for example, would output `10` as the first element, then `20, 30, ...` up until `x=10+i*10` for some `i` where `i` ensures `x < stop` (which, in this case, is `80`). So, the `80` I've used could equally have been `77` or even `71` and the outputted `list` would still be `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]`.

Putting all of that together should mean you understand the above code. You might want to run the code on your kit to see if it does what you expect it to.


Next Steps
----------

From here, you might want to take a look at the [basic IO](/docs/tutorials/basic_IO). You might also like to see if you can make the larger code example above more concise by creating functions for the repetitive parts. [This](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm) tutorial seems good if you're interested.
