Power Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/power_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased power board without LCD" title="An un-cased power board without LCD" class="right" />
The Power Board is the central piece of the electronics kit.
It runs the code that you write in the SR IDE and controls all of the other boards in the kit.
Your kit includes a single Power Board which is connected into the [Token Ring](/docs/kit/token_ring), it also has a USB hub connected to it which allows both the webcam and the USB memory stick to be plugged in.

The LiPo batteries do *not* support charging through the power board. They must be charged using the iMAX B6 charger provided. The power board is supplied with tape over the charger fuse slot and this should not be removed.

Note that there are now two revisions of the power board in the wild.
The 'SR13.F' revision does not have the charger connector and fuse.
