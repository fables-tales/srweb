JointIO Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/jointio_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased jointio board" title="An un-cased jointio board" class="right" />
The JointIO Board allows you to connect the SR kit to your own electronics. It has 8 inputs which can be configured to read either digital or analogue values and 8 digital outputs capable of driving small loads.
The board also provides 3.3V to power some/all of your electronics. Both the inputs and outputs of the board use 3.3V logic so you should keep this in mind when interfacing with the board.

Indicators
----------

|   LED           | Meaning                | Inital power-up state
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------
| Power           | The board is powered   | On
| SRIC Activity   | The board is transferring data | Off
| Token           | The token-ring is functioning | On
| 3.3V Power      | The 3.3V rail is active | Off
| Input           | Shows the perceived logic level of the input[^1] | N/A
| Output          | Shows the state of the output | Off

[^1]:
    The logic threshold is set to 1.65V (3.3V / 2).
    Anything higher than this will cause the corresponding LED to illuminate and the input to be read as `true` in code.
    Anything less than the threshold will turn the LED off and be read as `false` in the code.

Case Dimensions
---------------

All dimensions are in mm. Don't forget that the CAT5 cables stick out slightly.

Specification
-------------

|  Parameter                               |   Value   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Power Output Voltage                     | 3.3V      |
| Maximum 3.3V Rail Output Current         | 200mA     |
| Maximum Current Per Output               | 100mA     |
| Output High Voltage                      | 3.3V      |
| Output Low Voltage                       | 0V        |
| Maximum Input Voltage                    | 12V[^2]   |
| Maximum Measurable Input Voltage         | 3.3V      |
| Input Digital Threshold Voltage          | 1.65V     |

[^2]:
    Applying greater than 3.3V to an input can affect readings from the other inputs.
    It is strongly advised to keep all input signals in the range of 0-3.3V, you can use a potential divider to reduce higher voltages into that range.
