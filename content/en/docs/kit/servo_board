Servo Board
===========

<img src="/images/content/kit/servo_board.png" alt="A photo of an un-cased servo board" title="An un-cased servo board" class="right" />
The Servo Board can be used to control up to 8 RC servos.
Many devices are available that can be controlled as servos such as RC motor speed controllers and these can also be used with the board.
