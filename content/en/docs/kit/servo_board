Servo Board
===========

<div class="warning">This documentation is currently out-of-date, and is in the process of being rewritten.  It should be completed within the next week or so.</div>

The Servo Board can be used to control up to 8 RC servos.
Many devices are available that can be controlled as servos such as RC motor speed controllers and these can also be used with the board.
