Batteries and Charging
======================

<img src="/images/content/kit/imaxb6.jpg" alt="A photo of the iMAX B6 battery charger." title="An imax B6 battery charger" />
The electronics kit contains two 11.1V 2.2Ah lithium-ion polymer batteries and an iMAX B6 battery charger. Lithium-ion polymer (LiPo) batteries, similar to those used in laptops, are small and light for the amount of energy they contain. This is great for your robot but it is vital to treat such a high concentration of energy with respect. The battery charger controls the electrical current passed through the batteries to ensure they are charged safely.

<div class="warning">
<p>
LiPo batteries can get hot or catch fire when charging and in use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Never leave in use or charging batteries unattended</li>
  <li>Always use the correct charger</li>
  <li>Always follow the charging checklist precisely to make sure the charger is correctly configured</li>
  <li>Leave the charging leads connected to the battery charger at all times</li>
  <li>Do not charge a damaged battery</li>
</ul>

[Charging Checklist](/docs/kit/batteries#ChargingChecklist) {#ChargingChecklist}
------------------
This list must be followed carefully each time a battery is connected to the charger.

1.   Plug in the mains adapter and plug it into the battery charger.
1.   Connect the charging lead from the charger to the battery. Ensure you plug the lead into the charger first and the battery second to avoid risk of shorting the battery.
1.   Connect the monitoring lead from the battery to the charger.
1.   Configure the charger using the menu system as follows. After turning on the screen should show:

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>PROGRAM SELECT</td></tr>
<tr><td style="text-align: right;">LiPo BATT</td></tr>
</table>

If it does not repeatedly press `Batt.Type/Stop` until it does.

Press `Start/Enter` to select lithium battery charging.
The following screen may be the first shown if the charger has been used previously.

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>LiPo CHARGE</td></tr>
<tr><td>0.1A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.7V(1S)</td></tr>
</table>

Press `Inc.` to select Balance charging.

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>LiPo BALANCE</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.4A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.2V(6S)</td></tr>
</table>

Press `Start/Enter` to edit the charging current.

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>LiPo BALANCE</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.1V(3S)</td></tr>
</table>

The current (bottom left) should start blinking.
Use the `Inc.`/`Dec.` buttons until it reads `2.2A`.
Press `Start/Enter` to store the value and to begin editing the battery voltage.
Use the `Inc.`/`Dec.` buttons until it reads `11.1V(3S)`.

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>LiPo BALANCE</td></tr>
<tr><td>2.2A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.1V(3S)</td></tr>
</table>

Hold `Start/Enter` for 3 seconds to confirm. The charger will try to detect the battery. It *must* show:

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>R:3SER&nbsp;&nbsp;S:3SER</td></tr>
<tr><td>CONFIRM(ENTER)</td></tr>
</table>

The important thing to note here is that the number of cells detected by the charger (R) and the number of cells set by you (S) are both 3.
*If either of these numbers are different immediately power down the charger and contact Student Robotics.*

Press `Start/Enter` to commence charging

<table class="charger_lcd">
<tr><td>Li3S 2.2A 12.59V</td></tr>
<tr><td>BAL 022:43 00682</td></tr>
</table>

The screen shows the charging current (here: `2.2A`), the current voltage (here: `12.59V`), the time elapsed (here: `22m43s`) and the energy provided to the battery (here: `682mAh`).

The charger will beep when the battery is fully charged. You must then:

1.   Unplug the charger from the mains.
1.   Unplug the battery from the charging lead, do not unplug the charging lead from the charger with the battery still connected.
1.   Unplug the monitoring lead from the battery to the charger.

[Troubleshooting](/docs/kit/batteries#Troubleshooting) {#Troubleshooting}
-----------------

Charger beeps and displays `CONNECTION BREAK` during charging
:	Either the charging or monitoring lead has come loose.
	Ensure that both are fully inserted and press the following buttons to resume charging:

	`Batt.Type/Stop` &rarr; `Start/Enter` for 3 seconds &rarr; `Start/Enter`
