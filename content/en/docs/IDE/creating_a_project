Creating a New Project
======================

<div class="warning">This documentation is currently out-of-date, and is in the process of being rewritten.  It should be completed within the next week or so.</div>

Organising completely different versions of code (i.e. versions that aren't just changes of one another) can be done using multiple projects. You can only run one project on your robot at a time. 

To create a new project, navigate to the _Project_ tab and click on the _New Project_ button. You will be presented with a dialogue box asking for the project name (it's best if it's meaningful). Once you've given it a name, click _Save_ and you've got a shiny new project to play with.
