Markers
=======

<img src="/images/content/marker-0.png" alt="An Example Marker: Arena marker 0" class="right" />
An example *libkoki* marker is given to the right; this one is *arena-0*.
There is a dot in the top-left corner of the black border; this corner is known as the *principal corner*.
It may be important to know what (Z-)orientation rotations are measured from.
There is also some text in the bottom-left corner of the black border.
This text will say something like `"libkoki marker #0 (v0.5) 'ARENA'"`.
Let's break that down:
`#0` means marker number 0;
`(v0.5)` tells you the version of the marker, it is important the latest version is used; and
`'ARENA'` is just a human-readable description of what the marker is for.

The table below lists the *libkoki* markers that your robot will know about and what their meaning is:


| Use         | Range | Size          |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| Arena       | 00-27 | 250mm x 250mm |
| Robots      | 28-31 | 100mm x 100mm |
| Tokens      | 32-71 | 100mm x 100mm |
| Bucket Side | 72-75 | 100mm x 100mm |
| Bucket End  | 76-79 | 100mm x 100mm |


You can download all of these markers, as PDFs, in a single [ZIP file](/resources/markers/sr-dev-markers.zip).
Alternatively, you may download individual markers [here](/resources/markers/).
The *Arena* markers, due to their size, need to be printed on A3 paper.
All of the other markers can be printed on A4 paper, and are in a 4-up arrangement to help save paper.
Please make sure your system is not scaling the PDFs when printing them.
You can easily check this by measuring the width of the grey border around the markers and comparing it with the table above.
Any differences will make the distance estimations inaccurate.

Note that a different set of markers will be used for the competition (by adding 100 to all of the markers above).
This is not something you need to worry about, though.
We will handle this for you when your robot is started in a competition mode.

The white space around the markers is very important -- without it, the markers probably won't be recognised.
If the markers become damaged (scuff markers, tears, etc...) they will not function as well (if at all).
If this happens, it is best to just print another one.
