Python Troubleshooting
========================

<div class="warning">This documentation is currently out-of-date, and is in the process of being rewritten.  It should be completed within the next week or so.</div>

When attempting to run a simple program the error "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'next'" is seen
:	The main function is treated as a generator by the SR library.
	This means that it must contain at least one yield to work correctly.
	If you're trying out a very simple program just add a timeout yield e.g. `yield query.timeout(1)`
